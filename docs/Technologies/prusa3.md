# Kuka KR 30 R1100 Sixx

## Location

Main lab, 4 printers

## Technical Details

FDM Desktop Fabrication
**Model:** Original Prusa i3 MK3  
**Brand:** Prusa Research  
Heated build Chamber  
**Filament used:** PLA, PETG    

## Features

- Magnetic bed with swappable steel sheets:
 - For easy and quick 3D print removal.
  - 3 Types: smooth, textured and satin which do not require surface preparation (i.e., glue, tape)
 - The flexible steel sheets have a PEI powder coating.
 - The print bed can reach up to 100C.
- Optical filament sensor:
 - Enables automatic filament loading.
 - Lets the user know when the filament is running out and pauses the 3D print.
 - Detects filament jams and stops the 3D printing process.
- Power panic: if there is a power outage, the MK3 will go back to where it last left off when the power is back. This feature works without batteries.
- Sensing fans and Noctua: for more silence when 3D printing. Also, cooling from both sides of the extruder increases the 3D printer's overhang performance.
- New Y axis: gives the 3D printer a smoother look and a sturdier frame.
- Bondtech extruder: dual gears ensure a reliable grip on the filament to prevent filament from slipping. The extruder can reach up to 300C.
