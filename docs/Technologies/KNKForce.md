# HOW TO USE KNK FORCE
  
 ## Setup:
  
 ### Materials:
  
  * KNK Force
  * Charging Cable (has a sticker on it that says “KNK”)
  * WIFI Adapter or Ethernet cable 
  * Cutter blade
  * Cutting Mat
  * Pen ( necessary for print and cut only )

 ### For WIFI Connection:
  Plug the device in and plug the WIFI adapter into it

 ### For Ethernet Connection:
  Plug the ethernet and charging cable only

 ## Connection:

 * Press the start button
 * A blue light will blink (might take up to 1-2 minutes)
 * Another light will appear after the blinking
   -If it is Red: KNK doesn’t receive a connectable WIFI signal (WIFI adapter is required)
   -If it is Green: KNK is in recovery mode and needs a manual reset. See the instructions below
   -If it is White KNK is ready for the next step
 * Open WIFI settings from your PC and choose KNK_Force network
 * KNK is now connected to the PC

 ### Software:

 * Sure Cuts a Lot (SCAL) is a software that includes KNK Force machine support. See the download link [here](https://www.craftedge.com/download/downloads.php)
 * Softwares like Inkscape are also usable with KNK Force. However, most of them require an extension to connect the device.

 ### SCAL First Cut:

 * [This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJj5l7TY34) might help for the first cut to learn about the software.
 * You’ll need an IP Address to start cutting. (The KNK with Print and Cut sticker has 10.0.0.1 as an IP)
 * IP address can be obtained by:
    -plug an Ethernet into the machine and the PC
    -Run Command Prompt on PC
    -Type ipconfig and see the results of the Ethernet Cable.
    Or
    -Connect KNK to WIFI
    -Connect to the KNK via WIFI
    -Download Angry IP and search for the device

 ## Recovery Mode:
   
   ### Getting the device into recovery mode:
    
 * Unplug the WIFI adapter and plug the ethernet cable
 * Turn on the KNK and wait for the red light (might take 1-2 minutes)
 * Take the ethernet cable out and back in. Also, plug the WIFI adapter this time
 * Wait for the lights to turn green
 * Now the device is in recovery mode

   ### Setting up a KNK with recovery mode:

 *	Select the KNK_Force_Recovery network from WIFI connections. A page will open up on the screen
 * Select LAN if you want to continue the connection with ethernet
 * Save the changes and click continue
 * An IP address will open up.
 * Connect to your regular WIFI network and refresh your KNK connection from SCAL
 * It is connected and you are all set!
